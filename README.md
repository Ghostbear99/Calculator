# Calculator--WIP-
Simple Calculator that can do simple things. Can also solve a quadratic equation. It will also be able to do graphing. It will eventually have a GUI interface.

METHODS
  
  setUp: Handles the setup of the calculator. Essentially the users introduction to the calculator. Asks the user what they want to do and displays the menu,
  
  Menu:  Displays what the user can do with the calculator in a list

  Subtraction: Handles subtraction
  
  Division: Handles division
  
  Multiplicaiton: Handles the multiplication
  
  Output: Prints out the value globalmath
  
  -----WIP-------
 
 Quadratic: The calculator will be able to do the quadratic equation
  
 Graphing: Allow the user to enter in a standard form equation and the calculator will draw the graph
